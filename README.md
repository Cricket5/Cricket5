- ⚡ Fun fact: Sure, here's a fun fact about computer programming:

The term "bug" to describe a flaw in a computer program dates back to 1947 when Grace Hopper, a computer scientist and U.S. Navy rear admiral, discovered a moth stuck in a relay of the Harvard Mark II computer.
She famously taped the moth into the computer's logbook, noting, "First actual case of bug being found." This incident popularized the term "debugging" for the process of fixing errors in software.
